                <p><b>Koyo Village of Religion, is a place of effectively and efficiently learning about Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ through the Holy Scriptures.</b> 
                    <br/> 
                    According to the Book of James 1:5 “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him”. Hence this site is here to help you discover and live the absolute truths that will guide you in this mortality and subsequently lead you to the presence of God after this life.  Sometimes, you might ask yourself a question like “how can I know?” you can know this message (God’s word) is true. If you ask our Heavenly Father in prayer, you can receive an answer from Him through the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is also called the Spirit of God, and one of His roles is to witness, or testify, of the truth. As taught in the Bible, “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, faith, meekness, goodness, and temperance” (Galatians 5:22-23).</p>
