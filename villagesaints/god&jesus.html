                    <b>Distinguishing between our Heavenly Father and Son His Jesus Christ.</b> 
                    <br/>
                    Oftentimes, most people get confused with the difference between our Heavenly Father (God) and His Son Jesus Christ who is also God. Some people believed that there has been no point in time that anyone has seen God while other believed that Moses saw God face to face. Whatâ€™s more, some also believed Jesus Christ is the same as GOD the eternal Father. Therefore this site is here to provide you with sufficient scriptural knowledge on how to distinguish between these two individuals and aid you with simple and clear answers surrounding their attributes. Before beginning any search on this page I encourage you to pray and ask God for his Divine knowledge and guidance that will help you understand and analyze every single piece of information you come across on this site. 
                    The most effective and efficient way to address our Heavenly Father is through prayer.
