      <b>Koyo Village of Religion, is a place of effectively and efficiently learning about Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ through the Holy Scriptures.</b> 
      <br/> 
      According to the Book of James 1:5 “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him”. Hence this site is here to help you discover and live the absolute truths that will guide you in this mortality and subsequently lead you to the presence of God after this life.  Sometimes, you might ask yourself a question like “how can I know?” you can know this message (God’s word) is true. If you ask our Heavenly Father in prayer, you can receive an answer from Him through the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is also called the Spirit of God, and one of His roles is to witness, or testify, of the truth. As taught in the Bible, “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, goodness, and temperance” (Galatians 5:22-23).

        <b>Distinguishing between our Heavenly Father and Son His Jesus Christ.</b> 
        <br/>
        Oftentimes, most people get confused with the difference between our Heavenly Father (God) and His Son Jesus Christ who is also God. Some people believed that there has been no point in time that anyone has seen God while other believed that Moses saw God face to face. What’s more, some also believed Jesus Christ is the same as GOD the eternal Father. Therefore this site is here to provide you with sufficient scriptural knowledge on how to distinguish between these two individuals and aid you with simple and clear answers surrounding their attributes. Before beginning any search on this page I encourage you to pray and ask God for his Divine knowledge and guidance that will help you understand and analyze every single piece of information you come across on this site. 
        The most effective and efficient way to address our Heavenly Father is through prayer.
