<h1>About Me</h1> 
<img src="dk.jpg">
<h2>Emmanuel Diddeh Koyo Dolo</h2> 
<p>My name is Emmanuel, I was born in Bellemu Town Panta District Bong County,
Liberia but currently live in Ghana,I have been a member of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints over 18 years.</p> 
<p>I am a student of BYU-IDAHO pursuing BS in Applied Technology. I have great 
passion for Technology and I am going to use the knoweldge gaind From
BYU-IDAHO to contibute meaningfully in my family, the Church and the society.</p> 
<p>I love singing and listening to the Church Hymns, watching movies, reading, and
spending time with family members. My favorate quote is from Elder Clark B. Gilbert
which says "God focuses on your slope while the world focuses on our intercept."
And my fovorate scripture is D&C58:27. Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged
in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass 
much righteousness. It is my pleasure to meet all of you, and I am willing to learn from you as well.</p>  
<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
